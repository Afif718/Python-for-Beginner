#set is an unordered collection of unique object. if i put 2,2 two times then it will print it only one time.

my_set = {1,2,3,4,5,5};

print(len(my_set)) # it will print 5 only not 6 bcoz it will print 5, one time.
my_set.add(100);
my_set.add(2); # 2 will be not added in the set bcoz its already there.

print(my_set);


#we can convert a list into a set
my_list = [1,2,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8];
print(set(my_list))

#we can convert a set into a list
print(list(my_list))

#copy the set

new_set = my_set.copy();

print(new_set);
